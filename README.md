This project is designed to implement a package delivery system that delivers 40 packages using three trucks and two drivers throughout the Salt Lake City, UT area. In the current version, the project is written in Python and implements a Nearest Neighbor algorithm to find the shortest route. Per the requirements of the project, the trucks needed to deliver the packages in under 140 miles. As seen in the project, the program manages to accomplish this task in just 96 miles. There are multiple package constraints such as: packages arriving to the loading center at varying times, incorrect addresses, and differing deadlines. The data acquired for the project is from Excel files provided by WGU that are converted to csv files for the purposes of the program. The packages and all associated data are stored in a chaining hash table to allow for consistent lookup times. As the program currently stands, the packages are manually loaded into the trucks by the user prior to delivery.
